<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am an incoming PhD candidate at <a href='https://uwaterloo.ca/'></a>, supervised by <a href='https://uwaterloo.ca/computer-science/about/people/fhs'>Freda Shi</a>. I am currently pursuing a double major (English Linguistics & Computer Science) in <a href='https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/'>Zhejiang University</a> and expect to gain my B.A. in June, 2024. 

My undergraduate supervisor in School of International Studies is <a href='https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/shaobin'>Bin Shao</a>. I also work as an intern at <a href='https://westlakenlp.netlify.app/'>WestlakeNLP</a> with <a href='https://frcchang.github.io/'>Prof. Yue Zhang</a> (2021. June - now). Previously, I have been visiting <a href='https://statnlp-research.github.io/'>StatNLP</a> with <a href='https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/people/faculty/lu-wei'>Prof. Wei Lu</a> (2023.June - 2023. Oct).

I am recently reading and chatting to find future directions or topics to work on. Generally speaking, my interests are related to the following questions:

- Whether the model's proficiency (in contrast to N. Chomsky's capacity) / grammatical correctness / logic reasoning ability, cohesion and coherence / writing style / etc. differ across languages? How to design methods to generalize the proficiencies to minor languages? What about achieving this on smaller models?
- Can syntax parsing or formal semantics serve as tools for detecting more demands or phenomenon within the NLP fields?

Besides, my undergraduate research covers English lexicon etymology dataset building, logic-reasoning with LLMs, and long-document information retrieval with LLMs. I may not continue on these specific topics in the future, but I also welcome discussions about them.

<!-- My research interest includes neural machine translation and computer vision. I have published more than 100 papers at the top international AI conferences with total <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'>google scholar citations <strong><span id='total_cit'>260000+</span></strong></a> (You can also use google scholar badge <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DhtAFkwAAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url={{ url | url_encode }}&logo=Google%20Scholar&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a>). -->

# üìñ Educations
- *2019.09 - 2024.06 (now)*, <a href='https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/'>Zhejiang University</a>. I am currently pursuing a double major (English Linguistics & Computer Science). A double major means that excepting dissertation in BSCS, I am completing other core courses required by a CS double degree, e.g. OS, TCS. Besides, though the CS double-X does not require any AI courses, I still finished many of them e.g., ML, NLP, DS.

- *2016.09 - 2019.06*, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jinan_Foreign_Language_School'>Jinan Foreign Language School</a>: I was an English-language-guaranteed student from JFLS (exempting Chinese Gaokao). My continuous interest in STEM subjects and my previous experience in winning a 1st Prize in National Olympiad in Informatics in Provinces (NOIP2015, junior group) have driven me to explore and take a double major in Computer Science, which further nurtured my passion for Natual Language Processing (NLP) and Computational Linguistics (CL).

# üí¨ Invited Talks
- *2022.10*, I gave a presentation on Philosophy of Linguistics at WestlakeNLP. Many thanks to <a href='https://dnaihao.github.io/research.html'>Naihao Deng</a> for arranging this meeting!

<!-- # üíª Internships

# üéπ Interesting Things!
- I have a blog <a href='https://ruoxining.github.io/OBvault'>üèõÔ∏è Mini Babel Library</a> written mostly in Chinese Mandarin. I believe that taking notes is a good way forcing one to digest the knowledge duing learning and reinforce the understanding. Welcome to explore my notes in CS, AI, linguistics, and life skills here!
